## About

Testing Grounds is a C++ and Unreal based FPS game where the player needs to navigate a seemingly infinite number of rooms whether by stealth or combat. 
The goal is always to reach the next room. The game will be made following the Unreal Engine Developer Course by Ben Tristem and Sam Pattuzzi[1] 
The game will evolve as the course progresses and my goal is to add more features once I finish the course. The features list will be modified accordingly.

## Features - planned and present

- Stealth mechanics
- AI Opponents
- Interactive puzzles
- Procedurally generated rooms
